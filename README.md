This project provides a dynamic array manipulation tool with a user-friendly menu interface. Users can dynamically create arrays, and then perform various operations including, appending elements, inserting elements, deleting elements, setting element values in a particular index, finding min/max, calculating sum, displaying the array, shifting, reverse, etc. This project is implemented in C++, and serves as a practical example of dynamic memory management and array manipulation techniques.
